[[traversal-java-api]]
= Traversal Framework Java API

[[traversal-java-api-traversaldescription]]
== link:{org-neo4j-graphdb-traversal-description}[TraversalDescription^]

The `TraversalDescription` is the main interface used for defining and initializing traversals.
It is not meant to be implemented by users of the Traversal Framework, but rather is provided as a way for the user to describe traversals.
`TraversalDescription` instances are immutable and its methods return a new `TraversalDescription` that is modified compared to the object the method was invoked on with the arguments of the method.
The method `traverse()` returns the result of the traversal defined in the `TraversalDescription`.

[[traversal-java-api-traverser]]
== Traverser

The `Traverser` object is the result of invoking `traverse()` on a `TraversalDescription`.
It represents a traversal positioned in the graph, and a specification of the format of the result.
The actual traversal is performed lazily each time the `next()`-method of the iterator of the `Traverser` is invoked.

=== Example
Here is an example of a Traversal with default values (Uniqueness: _NODE_GLOBAL_, Expander: _BOTH_, Branch Ordering: _PREORDER_DEPTH_FIRST_):
[source, java]
----
TraversalDescription td;
try ( Transaction tx = graphDb.beginTx() ) {
     td = tx.traversalDescription();
}

Traverser traverser = td.traverse( startNode );

for ( Path path : traverser ) {
    // Extend as needed
}
----

The `Traverser` additionally exposes methods for reading the last `relationships()` and `nodes()` for
each of the returned `Paths` and `metadata()` which has convenience methods for finding the total
number of returned paths, `getNumberOfPathsReturned()` and the number of relationships traversed `getNumberOfRelationshipsTraversed()`.

== Relationships

The method `relationships()` defines relationship types, and optionally the relationship direction, to be traversed.
By default, all relationships are traversed, regardless of type.
If one or more relationships are added then only the added types will be traversed.

[source, java]
----
TraversalDescription td = transaction.traversalDescription()
    .relationships(RelationshipType.withName("A"))
    .relationships(RelationshipType.withName("B"), Direction.OUTGOING);
return td.traverse(startNode);
----

[[traversal-java-api-evaluator]]
== Evaluator

An `Evaluator` takes the link:{org-neo4j-graphdb-path}[`Path`] from the start node to the current node and decides whether:

* The path should be included in the result
* The path should be expanded for further evaluation

Given a `Path`, an evaluator can take one of four actions:

* `Evaluation.INCLUDE_AND_CONTINUE`: Include the current node in the result and continue the traversal.
* `Evaluation.INCLUDE_AND_PRUNE`: Include the current node in the result, but do not continue the traversal.
* `Evaluation.EXCLUDE_AND_CONTINUE`: Exclude the current node from the result, but continue the traversal.
* `Evaluation.EXCLUDE_AND_PRUNE`: Exclude the current node from the result and do not continue the traversal.

As more than one evaluator can be added, when chaining them all of them are combined, such that:

* A path is included if all evaluators include it.
* A path will only be expanded if none of the evaluators prune it.

[NOTE]
====
Evaluators will be called for all paths the traverser encounters, even for the path consisting only of the start node.
====

=== Built-in Evaluators

The Framework also provides various built-in evaluators such as:

* `Evaluators.all()`: Includes and continues on all nodes.
* `Evaluators.atDepth(int)`: Includes only paths at the given depth, pruning everything else.
* `Evaluators.toDepth(int)`: Includes paths up to the given depth, pruning everything deeper.
* `Evaluators.fromDepth(int)`: Includes paths from the given depth, ignoring those before and never prunes anything.
* `Evaluators.includingDepths(int, int)`: Includes only the paths of depth equal to and between the 2 given depths.
* `Evaluators.lastRelationshipTypeIs(Evalutation, Evaluation, RelationshipType...)`: Allows the choice of which evaluation to take based on
whether the last relationship matches one of the given ones.
* `Evaluators.includeWhereLastRelationshipTypeIs(RelationshipType...)`: Only returns paths in which the final relationship matches the given ones.
* `Evaluators.endNodeIs(Evaluation, Evaluation, Node...)`: Allows the choice of which evaluation to take based on
whether the last node matches one of the given nodes.
* `Evaluators.includeIfContainsAll(Node...)`: Returns a path if all given nodes are contained within it.
* `Evaluators.includeIfAcceptedByAny(PathEvaluator)`: Returns a path if any of the given evaluators include the current path.
* `Evaluators.endNodeIsAtDepth(int, Node...)`: Returns a path if one of the given nodes is at the given depth.

=== Example
Here is an example of how to use a built-in evaluator:
[source, java]
----
TraversalDescription td;
try ( Transaction tx = graphDb.beginTx() ) {
     td = tx.traversalDescription()
            .evaluator(Evaluators.atDepth(2));
}

td.traverse( startNode );
----

Here's an example of a custom implementation, including only paths which end with a node of a certain label:
[source, java]
----
class LabelEvaluator implements Evaluator {

    private final Label label;

    private LabelEvaluator(Label label) {
        this.label = label;
    }

    @Override
    public Evaluation evaluate(Path path) {
        if (path.endNode().hasLabel(label)) {
            return Evaluation.INCLUDE_AND_CONTINUE;
        } else {
            return Evaluation.EXCLUDE_AND_CONTINUE;
        }
    }
}
----

Here is an example of a combined evaluator, which will return all paths of length 2 that also have an end node with label `A`:
[source, java]
----
TraversalDescription td;
try ( Transaction tx = graphDb.beginTx() ) {
     td = tx.traversalDescription()
            .evaluator(Evaluators.atDepth( 2 ))
            .evaluator(new LabelEvaluator(Label.label("A")));
}

td.traverse( startNode );
----

[[traversal-java-api-uniqueness]]
== Uniqueness

Sets the rules for how positions can be revisited during a traversal as stated in `Uniqueness`.
The default is `NODE_GLOBAL`.

The various uniqueness levels that can be used in are:

* `NONE` -- Any node in the graph may be revisited.
* `NODE_GLOBAL` -- No node in the entire graph may be visited more than once.
This could potentially consume a lot of memory since it requires keeping an in-memory data structure remembering all the visited nodes.
* `RELATIONSHIP_GLOBAL` -- no relationship in the entire graph may be visited more than once.
Just like `NODE_GLOBAL` uniqueness, this could potentially use up a lot of memory.
But since graphs typically have a larger number of relationships than nodes, the memory overhead of this uniqueness level could grow even quicker.
* `NODE_PATH` -- A node may not occur previously in the path reaching up to it.
* `RELATIONSHIP_PATH` -- A relationship may not occur previously in the path reaching up to it.
* `NODE_RECENT` -- Similar to `NODE_GLOBAL` uniqueness in that there is a global collection of visited nodes each position is checked against.
This uniqueness level does however have a cap on how much memory it may consume in the form of a collection that only contains the most recently visited nodes.
The size of this collection can be specified by providing a number as the second argument to the TraversalDescription.uniqueness()-method along with the uniqueness level.
* `RELATIONSHIP_RECENT` -- Works like `NODE_RECENT` uniqueness, but with relationships instead of nodes.

=== Example
Here is an example of a traversal using a built-in `Uniqueness` constraint:
----
TraversalDescription td;
try ( Transaction tx = graphDb.beginTx() ) {
     td = tx.traversalDescription();
            .uniqueness( Uniqueness.RELATIONSHIP_GLOBAL )
}

td.traverse( startNode );
----

For an example demonstrating how to use uniqueness in a traversal see <<examples-uniqueness-of-paths-in-traversals, Uniqueness of Paths in traversals>>.

[[traversal-java-api-branchselector]]
== BranchSelector

A `BranchSelector` / `BranchOrderingPolicy` is used for selecting which branch of the traversal to attempt next.
This is used for implementing traversal orderings.

The Traversal Framework provides a few basic ordering implementations based on the link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search[depth-first^] and link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search[breadth-first^] algorithms:

* `BranchOrderingPolicies.PREORDER_DEPTH_FIRST` -- Traversing depth first, visiting each node before visiting its child nodes.
* `BranchOrderingPolicies.POSTORDER_DEPTH_FIRST` -- Traversing depth first, visiting each node after visiting its child nodes.
* `BranchOrderingPolicies.PREORDER_BREADTH_FIRST` -- Traversing breadth first, visiting each node before visiting its child nodes.
* `BranchOrderingPolicies.POSTORDER_BREADTH_FIRST` -- Traversing breadth first, visiting each node after visiting its child nodes.

[NOTE]
====
Breadth-first traversals have a higher memory overhead than depth-first traversals.
====

A `BranchSelector` carries state and hence needs to be uniquely instantiated for each traversal.
Therefore it is supplied to the `TraversalDescription` through a `BranchOrderingPolicy` interface, which is a factory of `BranchSelector` instances.

A user of the Traversal Framework rarely needs to implement their own `BranchSelector` or `BranchOrderingPolicy`, it is provided to let graph algorithm implementors provide their own traversal orders.
The link:{org-neo4j-graphalgo-package}[Neo4j Graph Algorithms package] contains for example a `BestFirst` order `BranchSelector` / `BranchOrderingPolicy` that is used in BestFirst search algorithms such as A* and Dijkstra.

=== Example
Given the following graph, these are the results of the branch ordering policies without any extra filter:

image::traversal_order_example_graph.png[align="center", role="middle", width=200]

[cols="1,1"]
|===
|Ordering policy |Order of the nodes in traversal

|`BranchOrderingPolicies.PREORDER_DEPTH_FIRST`
|a, b, d, c, e

|`BranchOrderingPolicies.POSTORDER_DEPTH_FIRST`
|d, b, e, c, a

|`BranchOrderingPolicies.PREORDER_BREADTH_FIRST`
|a, b, c, d, e

|`BranchOrderingPolicies.POSTORDER_BREADTH_FIRST`
|d, e, b, c, a
|===

=== BranchOrderingPolicy

A `BranchOrderingPolicy` is a factory for creating ``BranchSelector``s to decide in what order branches are returned
(where a branch's position is represented as a `Path` from the start node to the current node).

Depth-first and breadth-first are common policies and can be accessed by the convenience methods breadthFirst() / depthFirst().

This is equivalent to setting the `BranchOrderingPolicies.PREORDER_BREADTH_FIRST` / `BranchOrderingPolicies.PREORDER_DEPTH_FIRST` policy.

==== Example
[source, java, role="nocopy"]
----
TraversalDescription td;
try ( Transaction tx = graphDb.beginTx() ) {
     td = tx.traversalDescription()
            .depthFirst();
}

td.traverse( startNode );
----

[source, java, role="nocopy"]
----
TraversalDescription td;
try ( Transaction tx = graphDb.beginTx() ) {
     td = tx.traversalDescription()
            .order( BranchOrderingPolicies.PREORDER_BREADTH_FIRST );
}

td.traverse( startNode );
----

[[traversal-java-api-pathexpander]]
== PathExpander

The Traversal Framework uses a `PathExpander` to discover the relationships
that should be followed from a particular path to further branches in the traversal.

There are multiple ways of specifying a `PathExpander`:

* The built-in `PathExpander` define some commonly used ``PathExpander``s.
* The `PathExpanderBuilder` allows the combination of definitions.
* It is possible to write a custom `PathExpander` by implementing the `PathExpander` interface.

=== Built-in PathExpanders
The following path expanders can be found in the class `PathExpanders` and can be used to set a more specific `PathExpander` for the traversal:

* `allTypesAndDirections()` -- expands all relationships in all directions (default).
* `forType(relationshipType)` -- expands only relationships of a specific type.
* `forDirection(direction)` -- expands only relationships in a specific direction.
* `forTypeAndDirection(relationshipType, direction)` -- expands only relationships of a given type and a given direction.
* `forTypesAndDirections(relationshipType, direction, relationshipType, direction, ...)` -- expands only relationships of the given types and their specific direction.
* `forConstantDirectionWithTypes(relationshipType, ...)` -- expands only relationships of the given types, if they continue in the direction of the first relationship.

==== Example
Here's an example of setting a custom relationship expander, which only expands outgoing relationships with the type `A`:
[source, java, role="nocopy"]
----
TraversalDescription td = transaction.traversalDescription()
    .expand(PathExpanders.forTypeAndDirection( RelationshipType.withName( "A" ), Direction.OUTGOING ));
td.traverse( startNode );
----

=== PathExpanderBuilder
The `PathExpanderBuilder` allows the combination of different `PathExpander` definitions.
This provides a more fine-grained level of customization without having to write a `PathExpander` from scratch.
It contains a set of static method allowing the creation of a `PathExpander` with the following methods:

* `empty()` -- expands no relationships.
* `emptyOrderedByType()` -- expands no relationships, guarantees the order of how types will be expanded when any are added.
* `allTypesAndDirections()` -- expands all relationships in any direction.
* `allTypes(Direction)` -- expands all relationships in the given direction.

That PathExpander can then be further defined by the following methods:

* `add(relationshipType)` -- expands relationships of the given type.
* `add(relationshipType, direction)` -- expands relationships of the given type and direction.
* `remove(relationshipType)` -- remove the expansion of relationships of the given type.
* `addNodeFilter(filter)` -- adds a filter based on Nodes.
* `addRelationshipFilter(filter)` -- adds a filter based on Relationships.

==== Example
[source, java, role="nocopy"]
----
TraversalDescription td = transaction.traversalDescription()
    .expand(PathExpanderBuilder.empty()
                               .add(RelationshipType.withName("E1"))
                               .build());
td.traverse( startNode );
----

==== Custom PathExpander Example

Here's an example of a custom `PathExpander` which tracks the weight of the path in its `BranchState` and
only include paths if the total weight is smaller than the given maximum weight:
[source, java, role="nocopy"]
----
class MaxWeightPathExpander implements PathExpander<Double>
{

    private final double maxWeight;

    public MaxWeightPathExpander( double maxWeight ) {
        this.maxWeight = maxWeight;
    }

    @Override
    public Iterable<Relationship> expand( Path path, BranchState<Double> branchState )
    {
        if (path.lastRelationship() != null) {
            branchState.setState( branchState.getState() + (double) path.lastRelationship().getProperty( "weight" ) );
        }

        Iterable<Relationship> relationships = path.endNode().getRelationships( Direction.OUTGOING );
        ArrayList<Relationship> filtered = new ArrayList<>();
        for ( Relationship relationship : relationships ) {
            if ( branchState.getState() + (double) relationship.getProperty( "weight" ) <= maxWeight ) {
                filtered.add(relationship);
            }
        }
        return filtered;
    }

    @Override
    public PathExpander reverse()
    {
        throw new RuntimeException( "Not needed for the MonoDirectional Traversal Framework" );
    }
}
----

Using the custom `PathExpander` and setting the initial state:
[source, java, role="nocopy"]
----
TraversalDescription td = transaction.traversalDescription()
        .expand( new MaxWeightPathExpander(5.0), InitialBranchState.DOUBLE_ZERO );
td.traverse( startNode );
----
